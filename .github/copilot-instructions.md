## llms.txt

Whenever you make changes to the `/blog` section or add a new blog post, check if the `nuxt.config.ts` file needs to be updated in the `llms` section.

Make sure that:
1. The page title and description are up to date
2. The Blog section reflects current content
3. The notes values match the current state of the website
