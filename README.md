# Personal Website

This project is a personal website, designed to showcase professional work, share insights through a blog, and provide a central point of contact. It serves as a digital portfolio to attract potential clients, employers, and collaborators.

Built with [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction), a modern web framework, this website is designed to be fast, SEO-friendly, and easily maintainable.
