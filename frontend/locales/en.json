  "blog.higherEducation.content2": "Are you capable of learning a language on your own? A new technology? A new tool?",
  "blog.higherEducation.content3": "When you buy a new device, is it out of necessity or the excitement of discovering its capabilities?",
  "blog.higherEducation.content4": "Maybe, like me, you have developed specialized skills, impressive knowledge, or abilities that are worth admiring?",
  "blog.higherEducation.content5": "Congratulations. You have access to a golden tool that many fight for and desire.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content6": "Yes, I learned this on my own and quite easily.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content7": "But this post is not strictly about me. It is not about boasting (although some will surely do so).",
  "blog.higherEducation.content8": "For a very long time, I proudly and satisfactorily developed myself independently, using various sources. I was not a fan of higher education. I did not see myself there.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content9": "And you know what?",
  "blog.higherEducation.content10": "Now I am. And how.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content11": "Somewhere at the beginning of March 2024, I spontaneously decided to enroll in Business Psychology at Merito University.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content12": "You can always drop out after all, I lose nothing.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content13": "And oh boy, how much I have gained in these few months (I am only in the 2nd semester)!",
  "blog.higherEducation.content14": "I will focus here on the less obvious aspects.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content15": "1. Social value",
  "blog.higherEducation.content16": "I expected to meet nice people. But it far exceeded my expectations.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content17": "I ended up in a group where several people run their own businesses. People have their own careers, manage teams, lead projects. This creates incredible opportunities for business collaboration.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content18": "With two of them, I have already built a close relationship over 7 months where we support each other personally and professionally. Greetings to Klaudia and Piotrek :) I am sure this is just the beginning.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content19": "you will meet people who will change your life.",

  "blog.higherEducation.content23": "For example: I spontaneously saw a poster about a competition for an IT project related to AI. I spent a minimal amount of time building the concept because it took me about an hour.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content24": "Did I win? No.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content25": "But I started the project anyway because I see potential in it. I am in the process of implementation, learning project and team management. I plan to implement it, launch it into the world, and maybe even monetize it someday. More information on this soon :)",
  "blog.higherEducation.content26": "you will be inspired and have more perspectives to act.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content27": "3. Method of acquiring knowledge",
  "blog.higherEducation.content28": "If you learn independently, you surely know that it is a demanding process. You must not only assimilate knowledge but also have a plan and control the entire process.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content29": "In higher education, all this is facilitated. You have a plan prepared by specialists, you have textbooks that someone wrote for months, you have the support of people smarter than you.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content30": "By delegating the planning and control process, you can focus on other activities. For example, assimilating knowledge, but also on the private aspects of life.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content31": "you will learn more effectively.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content32": "4. Your vocabulary",
  "blog.higherEducation.content33": "During classes, you will learn new words, new concepts, new definitions. In one class, we had to give a speech. Overcome the fear in a situation that paralyzes many.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content34": "But something else struck me.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content35": "After months of learning, I noticed a drastic change in my speech. When I had job interviews, I felt that I spoke with conviction, with knowledge, with confidence. When I talked to friends, I was calmer, more eloquent, showed more love.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content36": "You will feel more confident.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content37": "I knew what I wanted and how to justify it. I could sell myself and my values.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content38": "your charisma and communication skills will increase.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content39": "5. Value of knowledge",
  "blog.higherEducation.content40": "You know exactly what it's about. Your grandmother, mother, father, and teachers at school have repeated it to you. My goal is not to repeat it.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content41": "I will just add that we are a set of interconnected vessels. The knowledge you acquire will certainly affect your life.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content42": "Maybe you will build the identity of an intelligent person who has strength and is capable of great things? Maybe you will know more about human behavior and will not use punishment and violence against your children because you know how harmful it is? Or maybe you will find out that it is not always worth taking anti-inflammatory drugs when you have a fever?",
  "blog.higherEducation.content43": "you will be smarter.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content44": "My goal was to present to you some less obvious aspects of studies, as well as to share my experience. A lot has changed, and I think it is worth sharing your thoughts.",

  "blog.edducamp2024.content.description2": "In the lecture on family scripts, we received a large dose of statistics on the impact of the family environment on children. In short, it showed a behavioral approach to human development. It's worth recalling and showing examples.",
