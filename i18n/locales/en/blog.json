  "blog.higherEducation.content5": "Congratulations. You have access to a golden tool that many fight for and desire.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content6": "Yes, I learned this on my own and quite easily.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content7": "But this post is not strictly about me. It is not about boasting (although some will surely do so).",
  "blog.higherEducation.content8": "For a very long time, I proudly and satisfactorily developed myself independently, using various sources. I was not a fan of higher education. I did not see myself there.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content9": "And you know what?",
  "blog.higherEducation.content10": "Now I am. And how.",
  "blog.higherEducation.content11": "Somewhere at the beginning of March 2024, I spontaneously decided to enroll in Business Psychology at Merito University.",

  "blog.edducamp2024.content.description2": "In the lecture on family scripts, we received a large dose of statistics on the impact of the family environment on children. In short, it showed a behavioral approach to human development. It's worth recalling and showing examples.",
  "blog.edducamp2024.content.description3": "When Mateusz talked about psychometric traits, he showed the application of the control function derived from management to analyze our lives. I must admit, speed particularly caught my attention. Maybe because I am a person who likes to do things slowly and diversely. And that doesn't favor speed. So I have a point to improve.",
  "blog.edducamp2024.content.negative": "Not everything is perfect, of course. Sometimes the topics that were discussed I think were too general and not quite conveying value. Or I wasn't able to notice it ;) That was the case with the lecture on creativity. In my opinion, it was a bit... bland.",
